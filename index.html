            OpenTechSchool is a community-driven initiative, aiming to create a friendly, inclusive and welcoming environment, where people get together and get into, or better, at coding.
            During the workshops, learners will go through the material provided by us on their own peace and whenever they get stuck, coaches are there to help.
            This is not a conventional way to teach, but rather a supportive way to engage learners in coding.
